# Changelog

All notable changes to SovraHarness are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases are cut by pushing a
`vX.Y.Z` tag (see [README → Shipping](README.md#shipping)); installed apps
auto-update from the resulting GitHub Release via Velopack.

Add entries under **Unreleased** as part of the change that introduces them;
move them under a version heading when the tag is cut.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Enable keyboard navigation immediately when a window opens, before an input has been clicked.
- Size the title bar to fit the appearance control without clipping and verify keyboard theme switching.
- Align model names with their metadata and preserve usable Models controls at the minimum window size.

### Added

- **Main Chat, Login & Personal AI Builder (`sovra-ui`, `sovra-core`)**:
  - 3-column post-login workspace (`Sidebar`, `ChatView` with `"Built around you."` hero banner and prompt timeline counter, and `My Personal AI` right inspector with 6 configuration cards and `"Preview my AI"` workflow) plus a native glass Login screen.
  - Native AG-UI (`adk-ui = "2.2.0"`) surface rendering (`BuildProgress` live checklist card, `ClarifyChips`, and `SurfaceCard`) and `SovraSRX` type-ahead prompt queue strip.
  - `SovraSRX` **Schedules Command Center** (`NavTab::Schedules`) with KPI cards (`Active Schedules`, `Runs Today`, `30d Success Rate`), Pause/Resume controls, and one-click `"Run in Chat"` execution.
- **Multi-Provider Model Library & Discovery (`sovra-providers`, `sovra-adk`, `sovra-ui`)**:
  - Live catalog discovery, caching, and OS keychain credential storage (`keyring`) for **OpenRouter** (all models & modalities), **Ollama** (local tags, metadata enrichment, and streaming model pulls), **OpenAI-compatible** servers (`LM Studio`, `vLLM`, `llama.cpp`, custom `/v1` endpoints), **Anthropic**, and **Google Gemini**.
  - Virtualized **Models** view with search, capability/modality/context/price filters, side-by-side model comparison, and connection management.
- **22 `SovraSRX` Specialist Agents & `CogniRouteSLM` Dynamic Tree Router (`sovra-core`, `sovra-adk`, `sovra-ui`)**:
  - Full 22-specialist `SovraSRX` roster (`OrchestratorAgent`, `WebSearchAgent`, `CodingAgent`, `DeepResearchAgent`, `StockMarketAgent`, `HousingMarketAgent`, `ScholarAgent`, `GitHubAgent`, etc.) with per-agent model and tier (`Tier 0 · Fast`, `Tier 1 · Standard`, `Tier 2 · Deep`) overrides.
  - Three selectable model routing modes in **My AI's & Routing Tree**: `Single Global Model`, `Per-Agent Models (22 Specialists)`, and `Dynamic Tree Router`.
  - System-1 decision model client (`sovra_adk::decision_client`) supporting **Laya** (`/v1/systemone`), **OpenJev / TypeSafe Jev** (`/v1/systemone` and OpenRouter `/api/alpha/decisions`), and an **Embedded Rust Heuristic** engine (`0ms` offline fallback) with `heuristic_floor`, auditable node-by-node traces, and `rc1-<tree>-<path>` route codes.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-24

Initial import of the native Rust desktop harness.

### Added

- Workspace of layered crates with machine-enforced dependencies
  (`app → ui → runtime → core`, table in `xtask/src/deps.rs`):
  - `sovra-core` — pure domain: types, `Command`/`Event` protocol, state
    reducers, ports (`MemoryStore`). No IO, async runtime, or GUI.
  - `sovra-adk` — ADK agent harness adapter.
  - `sovra-providers` — LLM provider adapters.
  - `sovra-runtime` — tokio on a background thread, serving the UI over
    channels (`Client`).
  - `sovra-store-surreal` — embedded SurrealDB adapter for `MemoryStore`
    with bi-temporal, supersede-don't-edit facts.
  - `sovra-ui` — GPUI views via `gpui-kit`, with the native Sovra design
    system under `src/design/` (dark + light themes).
  - `sovra-app` — binary and composition root: Velopack hook, paths,
    logging, wiring.
- `xtask` automation: `dev` (watch + rebuild + relaunch), `run`, `ci`,
  `fix`, `check-deps` (layering), `check-styles` (styling contract and
  contrast), `setup`, `dist`, and the editor `hook` (rustfmt + clippy on
  every agent edit).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running every gate, and release
  packaging (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) producing signed Velopack
  installers for macOS, Windows, and Linux from a `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- Dependency policy: `deny.toml` (license allowlist, no OpenSSL, no git
  deps), `clippy.toml`, workspace-level lints, pinned Rust 1.99.1.
- Documentation: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/development.md`,
  `docs/styling.md`, agent rules in `AGENTS.md` (plus per-crate files).
