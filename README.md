Native Rust desktop app for the Sovra agent harness. GPUI (via `gpui-kit`) UI, tokio runtime,
embedded SurrealDB memory (vector + graph + full-text in one engine, behind a swappable
`MemoryStore` port), Velopack installers with auto-update. macOS, Windows, Linux from one
codebase.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Rust via https://rustup.rs — the pinned toolchain (1.99.1) installs itself on first build
# 2. Linux only: ./scripts/install-linux-deps.sh
cargo xtask setup    # once: install pinned development tools
cargo xtask dev      # start only if the existing sovraRust watcher is absent
```

That's it — no Node, no Python, no system packages on macOS/Windows.

## Everyday commands

| Command                  | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cargo xtask dev`        | Persistent live reload: watch, rebuild/relaunch, stream logs  |
| `cargo xtask run`        | Launch the app (debug)                                       |
| `cargo xtask ci`         | Every gate: fmt, clippy, layering, cargo-deny, unused deps, tests |
| `cargo xtask fix`        | Auto-apply fmt + clippy fixes                                |
| `cargo xtask check-styles` | Check native styling boundaries and the bundled SVG logo  |
| `cargo xtask setup`      | Install pinned CI tools and Watchexec                       |
| `cargo xtask dist`       | Release build (+ installers if Velopack `vpk` is installed)  |

Logs stream directly in the dev pane, with files under the OS data dir
(`~/Library/Application Support/com.Sovra.SovraHarness/logs` on macOS). The runner
preserves an existing `RUST_LOG` filter and defaults to focused application debug logs.

For development, use the existing **`sovra:sovraRust`** tmux window: the watcher and
live logs stay running there. Save Rust or embedded asset changes to rebuild and
relaunch automatically; no manual start/stop is needed. This resets in-memory
state rather than hot-swapping Rust code. Setup and operating rules:
[`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md).

## Shipping

Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds each OS, signs + notarizes (when the
secrets listed in that file are set), produces Velopack installers (`.pkg` on macOS,
`Setup.exe` on Windows, AppImage on Linux) and publishes a GitHub Release that installed apps
auto-update from.

## For contributors and AI agents

Workflow and best practices: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Canonical rules:
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (read natively by Codex and Cursor; imported by `CLAUDE.md`
for Claude Code), plus a short `AGENTS.md` per crate. Reasoning: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).
Edits are checked automatically by `cargo xtask hook` (Claude Code + Cursor hooks) and by CI.
Notable changes are tracked in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); security and secrets policy
in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

The native Sovra dark/light design system, embedded SVG branding, usage examples and
research sources are documented in [`docs/styling.md`](docs/styling.md). The welcome
screen's appearance control previews both modes (session only).
